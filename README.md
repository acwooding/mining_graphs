# Mining Complex Networks - Practical Methods for Mining Graphs using Python-igraph

**Part 1: EDA**

- 1.1 Relational data as graphs
    - basic igraph commands, main dataset, types of graphs
- 1.2 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - degree, paths, connected components
- 1.3 Node importance: 
    - coreness, centrality, betweenness

**Part 2: Clustering**

- 2.1 Transitivity
    - triangles and other motifs, local and global clustering coefficients, cliques
- 2.2 Clustering: modularity, Louvain, Leiden, ECG and properties; other methods
    - illustrations on various graphs; measures of cluster quality; ego-nets vs clusters
- 2.3 Random graph models and benchmarks (ex: Erdos-Renyi, ABCD)
- 2.4 Extra module: Anomaly detection
    - illustration with football dataset

## Software environment

The Python Notebook was created under the following conda environment:

```
conda create --name mining_graphs python=3.7.9 numpy pandas jupyter matplotlib pycairo scikit-learn
source activate mining_graphs
pip install igraph
pip install partition-igraph

python -m ipykernel install --user --name=mining_graphs ## add to Jupyter
```

The environment can be optionally created, managed and maintained reproducibly using `make` commands. To create and activate the conda environment:
```
make create_environment
source activate mining_graphs
```
